Trade Money	- 1/5 of Total Reserves Value [Say Trade only with 20k if you have 100k]

Rules: 
Consistent Profit with less risk can be achieved by booking profit near Important Resistance or Support identified during Consolidation days (or) Maximum profit with high risky can be achieved by holding till momentum exists during Strong Trending days
Do NOT Trade AGAINST the Larger TREND, Trade with Trend - Buy on every dip or Sell on every raise aligned with the Trend, Do NOT hold overnight position in counter Trend direction, hold overnight position (30 to 60%) in Trend side only for Jackpot as Tend will continue ferociously. Do not hold more than 60% of overnight position, as Gap in opposite side may wipeout to nothing. Probability of Market move along with impulse side or larger trend side is more than corrective side, Option have great value appreciation on unexpected / larger trend side than the expected / counter trend side. Market can crazily go to any extent along the Trend side, When 1 Hour RSI is between 70 to 80 extended bullish move will happen or RSI between 30 to 20 extended bearish move will happen
During Strong Trend Hold Profitable position as long as possible and reap maximum profit by holding as long as Trend continues in 5 minutes [Bullish or Neutral Candle for Upside] or [Bearish or Neutral for Downside] until till Reversal happens 
Some times market move falsely in opposite side for a Good or Bad News, but subsequently it vehemently React to the News appropriately. 
Large Move Pattern => 1) Consolidation within a tight range 2) Multiple Failure to break important resistant or support with very fast and threatening move in opposite direction and slowly recovers 3) Break out happens with less speed move 4) Fast correction or pull back near important Support or Resistance to threaten inexperienced traders to close Trend side position out of fear, S/R usually gets support at 9 EMA in 1 hour chart, Hold Overnight Trend side position as next day it will break the S/R strongly 5) Final Stage Huge Gap and Extended move beyond anyone’s expectation [Free fall or Free Up move], hold position Till Trend reversal is confirmed and reap maximum profit in this stage [usually when 1 Hour RSI is usually between 70 to 80 or 30 to 20]
Do NOT OVERTRADE or Do NOT Take position somewhere in the middle during Consolidation or for Counter Trend like buying and selling Calls / Puts meaninglessly with just assumptions [not near any Support or Resistance] and lose the booked profit, Reversal Trade only when double bottom or double top or Failed Complex correction is formed with a couple of Candles with opposite side near Support or Resistance, But Trend side you can enter anytime as early as possible or During correction to moving averages with Candle confirmation of Trend continuation. It is very RISKY to take Counter Trend or Consolidation during Strong Trending move as you may not know when Trend will continue vehemently (unless Trend exhausted and weakness with consolidation) 
Stop loss Exit Trade only when Last Lower Top or Higher Bottom breaks in opposite side (or) break of previous Swing High or Low (or) A Large Candle or Couples of Candle moves in opposite side and closes above or below multiple previous trend candles. 
First Time important Resistance or Support are always respected, 2nd or 3rd time it may hold or break swiftly during strong Trending day, so wait for reversal or break out confirmation 
Do not Trade for the first 10 minutes, as Market fluctuates too much and become unpredictable and also premium drops so fast. Analyze the first 5mts candle and decide trade patiently. First 45mts is usually creates multiple swings so book profit near every S/R levels 
After 2:00pm on Expiry - Expose only 25% of Trade money and swift movement will wipe out premium to zero. (Both in the money or out of money position), Hence, keep strict stop loss for every position to fix maximum loss
During Impulsive Move, make sure Wave 5 also completed, please avoid reversal Trading during wave 4 or 2 formation or take reversal trade only after multiple factors support it 
During Range Day trading => If range is small multiple times it may move between S/R, but if range is too large mostly it may hit the range only twice (one up one down only), so avoid reversal after second time if range is too large, Either range is small or large, identify the Trend line pattern like Triangles, Range bound, H&S, etc. and identify the Trade Opportunity  
Trend will continue => with Single Swing or with 3 Swing Complex correction pattern with fresh Lower Bottom or Higher Top Should be formed, Otherwise consolidation or reversal will happen. Trade for Reversal only when Swing 1 is broken after Double Top or Double Bottom
Consolidation => Trend will become Consolidation when 3 Swing Complex Pattern does not form fresh Low or High, instead 4th Swing is formed
Watch out for Price acceleration or deceleration, trend steepness, Impulse height and retracement depth  
Fibonacci: 0.236->2.618 / 0.382->2.414 / 0.50->2.00 / 0.618->1.618 / 0.78.6->1.414 / 0.882->1.272 / 100 
Do not take position before an important event when premium is too high 
When a large Gap or Red or Green candle [ORB] is formed in the first 5 or15 minutes then the whole day will be in that direction unless it retraces more than 38% or 50%
Book profit when prices reached important support or resistance, don’t expect it will break and move further, probability of pull back or bounce is higher than breaking support or resistance or when option position reaches 100% gain from best price range for the day always take out initial investment
Any day maximum loss should be limited to 38% of allocation limit for the day (say 20,000 is allocated for a day then max stop-loss should be 7,640). Once max stop-loss for the day is reached or After 3 continues failure trade STOP trading for the rest of the day as you perception is wrong and you will continue to trade wrong and continue to lose money due to Revenge trading and emotional Trading.
Once huge profit is achieved don’t bet the entire money and loss large value subsequently. Always trade for the amount fixed for that daily limit say 20,000. 
Do not increase the allocation after a loss trade, instead reduce exposure w.r.t the available amount allocated for the day 
Everyday be ready for both upside or downside or consolidation movement, do NOT trade market with your own expectations, instead validate each move with Technical Factors  
Experience shows aligning Elliot Wave direction and projection based on Larger Trend, Trend Line, CPR, Previous Day High / Low, Swing High / Low, Important Resistance / Supports Moving Averages, 1 Hour RSI and WVAP is better risk management and profitability as you will be always in the trend side than trading against the trend and losing money with wrong Elliot Wave assumptions [Note: Elliot pattern changes dynamically]
Check for holidays for every weekly expiry contracts
Usually weak gap up or gap down are filled, wait for first 5 minutes to understand the market. Global market behavior to some extend influence the opening, but market will follow its own trend subsequently. Market will move opposite of what most people believe, Market moves to unbelievable levels
Exit option position on every important resistance or support and rebuy on pull backs or end of correction, so that option profit can be booked at peak value and rebought at lower price
Corrective may not always look like A-B-C structure. Entire corrective wave (A-B-C) can complete as single impulse (or) some cases even wave B formed like clear impulse or as gap up or down. Retracement levels are important than the wave structure esp. for corrective wave. If Wave B will be Irregular (i.e. breaking the start of Wave A) only when Wave A is 3 Wave type. If wave A is impulse, wave B to may not be Irregular (breaking the start of Wave A). Do not trade for Wave C, without reversal confirmation as Impulse may continue strongly in the trending direction.

Your results will vary anywhere on the scale from consistent loser to consistent winner, dependent on: 
Your ability to perceive the shifting forces of strength and weakness within the market, and place that within the context of higher timeframe structure, in order to identify the likely future direction of price action; 
Your ability to identify areas of trade opportunity within that price action, and to time entry and exit decisions in order to minimize risk and maximize profit potential; 
Your ability to trust yourself and your strategy, with sufficient confidence to allow you to take the entry and exit signals without hesitation. 
All three of the above are a result of experience. They don’t come from reading this book. They don’t come from watching a video of me trade. They come as a result of getting in the market and trading; making mistakes, identifying them, learning from them, and improving. 
Learning to operate in the uncertain market environment, is a process (or journey) of gradual improvement. 
So, why will most fail? Simply, *because they won’t last the journey! They’ll quit before they make it.

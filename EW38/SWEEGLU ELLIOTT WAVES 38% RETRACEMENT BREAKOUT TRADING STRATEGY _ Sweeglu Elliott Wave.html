<p>Sweeglu Elliott Waves is going
to share most Accurate and Profitable Trading Strategy based on 38% retracement
breakout of Elliott Wave Theory. People say 61% is Golden Retracement Fibonacci
Ratio, but we are going to prove with real life facts and examples that 38%
retracement is way more golden than 61% and it can make a trader rich if he/she
knows how and when to use it.</p>



<h2><strong>Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% Retracement Breakout Strategy:</strong></h2>



<p>The 38% retracement breakout
trading strategy which we are going to share in this article is not something
like secret. We are not saying it as secret because Sweeglu Elliott Waves never
keep secrets, we always provide our Stock Market outlook with detailed analysis
and calculations, and everything whatever we are doing is on our website. Even
we suggest trades with reason and chart explanation to our clients. </p>



<p>We are declaring this Sweeglu
Elliott Waves 38% retracement trading strategy as most accurate and profitable
because we can earn a good profit with lowest risk even if we are wrong at
overall Elliott Wave Counting. And this single Sweeglu Elliott Waves trading
strategy alone is capable to transform your analysis and trading to the
professional level.</p>



<p>Before explaining the
techniques and calculations of 38% retracement breakout trading strategy, we
want to advise readers that read this article very carefully without missing a
line because every word is important. This article is bit lengthy because we
tried to explain it in such a way that even a newbie can understand. Investing
some time in reading this article and comparing the written explanation with
charts will provide you the roadmap to success in Stock Market Analysis and
Trading which you will not get anywhere else even if you pay 1000s.&nbsp; Even experienced Stock Market Analysts and
researchers will get a worthy subject for their research. This single article
is worthy than most of the costly books and courses available in the market. So
let’s start from the Simple end.</p>



<p>We are starting the
explanation with a recent Nifty trade which we suggested to our “Live Update
Subscribers” recently on 01 Oct 2019 because that trade was based on this 38%
retracement breakout trading strategy. We generally provide detailed explanation
of our market outlook and trades using charts but Nifty is so volatile now days
that we tend to miss good trading opportunities if we concentrate on preparing
charts for clients. So, we are just providing outlook and trades now days so
that we don’t miss the opportunity by the time we prepare chart. </p>



<p>A Nifty selling trade was
suggested to “Live Update Subscribers” on 01 Oct 2019. Nifty registered day’s
high 10554 and declined back. Later selling was suggested on bounce after
touching 11487 in 11498-11512 range using exact stoploss of 11523 expecting
11408 as minimum downside target. </p>

<p>Now let me explain the reason
and calculations behind this trade on chart: –</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="./SWEEGLU ELLIOTT WAVES 38% RETRACEMENT BREAKOUT TRADING STRATEGY _ Sweeglu Elliott Wave_files/AC-1-Minute.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4062" width="524" height="506" srcset="http://sweeglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AC-1-Minute.png 570w, http://sweeglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AC-1-Minute-300x290.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px"></figure></div>



<p>This is 01 Minutes time bar chart of Nifty covering Intraday move of 01 Oct 2019.</p>



<p>Please have a careful look at
chart and try to identify the bounce from 11408-11534. The bounce from
11408-11534 looks a 3 waves move with 1st wave (a) completed from 11408-11465,
2<sup>nd</sup> wave (b) completed from 11465-11441 and 3<sup>rd</sup> wave (c)
completed from 11441-11534. </p>



<p>Within this 3 waves (abc)
bounce from 11408-11534, 3<sup>rd</sup> wave (c) from 11441-11534 is important.
23% retracement of wave (c) is placed at 11512, 38% retracement of this wave
(c) is placed at 11498 and 50% retracement of this wave (c) is placed at 11487.</p>



<p>38% retracement of wave (c)
11498 was trend reversal point and we call it Breakeven Point. Trading strategy
was to sell Nifty after break below 38% retracement (breakeven point) for
minimum target 11408 [start of (abc) move].</p>



<p>To confirm the break below 38%
retracement 11498, we waited for the touch of 50% retracement 11487. When Nifty
touched 11487 then we waited for bounce towards 38%-23% retracement 11498-11512
to sell with stoploss of 11523 (11 points above 23% retracement 11512).</p>



<p>Maximum Stoploss was 25 points
(from entry point 11498) and minimum target was 90 points (11498-11408 = 90).
This trade was giving minimum 90 points profit with risk of maximum 25 points
and remember, 90 points profit was minimum whereas maximum profit could extend
anywhere and maximum stoploss was just 25 points. Means, Profit ratio could
extend and loss ratio could be reduced. Minimum Risk Reward for the trade was
1:3.</p>



<p>Minimum target according to
Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% retracement trading strategy was 11441 (start of wave
(c)] but I suggested minimum target as 10408 based on overall pattern. Even
minimum target of 11441 was giving risk reward of more than 1:2.</p>



<p>Now have a careful look at the
chart again to see what happened next. Nifty touched 11487 and then bounced to
touch entry range 11498 and declined back below 11408 till 11247.</p>



<p>01 Oct 2019 was the day when
Nifty first declined by 150 points from 11554 to 11408 and then bounced by more
than 120 points from 11408 to 11534 and then declined by more than 280 points
from 11534 to 11247. It was 146-126-287 point’s down-up-down swing but still we
managed to trade successfully with 25 points stoploss in such volatile
conditions. This is not the first time, we are doing it regularly on daily
basis.</p>



<p>Now, let me explain why we
sold in 11498-11512 range, why stoploss was 11523 and why target was 11408.</p>



<h2><strong>Rules, Techniques and Calculations of 38% Retracement Breakout Strategy:</strong></h2>



<p>We explained how we planned
trade based on 38% retracement but later is most important part. Now we are
going to reveal with real example that why we use 38% retracement to plan Low
Risk High Rewarding Trades and why it is most profitable and accurate.</p>



<p><strong>Most Important Part of 38% retracement strategy:</strong> Sweeglu Elliott Waves has observed and back tested since 2014 that whenever there is 3 waves move, then 23%-38% retracement of 3<sup>rd</sup> waves act as immediate Support/resistance and 38% retracement act as Trend Reversal or Breakeven Point.</p>



<p>In Elliott Wave Theory, a 3 wave’s move is always marked as (a), (b) and (c). But there are some cases when we don’t know if a 3 waves move is (a), (b), (c) or (1), (2), (3). When we are not sure if a 3 waves move is (abc) or (123) then we mark it as (a or 1), (b or 2) and (c or 3). Those who don’t understand Elliott Wave Cycle can read these two articles the clicking the link below:-</p>



<ol><li><a href="http://sweeglu.com/concept-of-elliott-wave-theory-explained-with-examples-waves-cycle/">Elliott Wave Theory Explained with Examples – Wave’s Cycle</a></li><li><a href="http://sweeglu.com/concept-of-elliott-wave-theory-explained-personalities-of-waves/">Concept of Elliott Wave Theory Explained – Personalities of Waves</a></li></ol>



<p>According to our observations
and research, 23%-38% retracement of 3<sup>rd</sup> wave (wave C or 3) in 3
waves move is always a support and 38% retracement is always a Trend Reversal
or Breakeven Point. And when price trades continuously below breakeven point
for more than 15 minutes or whenever price touches 50% retracement then same
38%-23% becomes resistance. </p>



<p>Later after confirming the break below 38%, possibility of&nbsp; wave (1), (2), (3) gets negated and 3 waves move become (abc), price again enters in 38%-23% retracement (resistance) and then reverse back till the start of (c) and start of (a). Start of (c) is minimum target and start of (a) is most probable targets and further targets can be calculated based on overall bigger pattern.</p>



<p>I explained the conditions keeping 3 waves (abc) move in upside direction, the conditions and calculations will be vise-versa in case of 3 waves move in downside trend.</p>



<p>It might be difficult to understand the terms “retracements” and “3 waves move” for those who are not aware of Elliott Wave Analysis yet. But everything will be clear and understandable after observing the examples and calculations on below chart.</p>



<p>I am using Hourly chart of Nifty to show the calculations and strategy perfectly and I am using very recent chart so the readers can check and back test the same by themselves.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="./SWEEGLU ELLIOTT WAVES 38% RETRACEMENT BREAKOUT TRADING STRATEGY _ Sweeglu Elliott Wave_files/03-Oct-2019-3-Copy.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4063" width="534" height="523" srcset="http://sweeglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/03-Oct-2019-3-Copy.png 569w, http://sweeglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/03-Oct-2019-3-Copy-300x294.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"><figcaption>Nifty Hourly Chart 1</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is hourly time bar chart
of Nifty covering move after 04 Aug 2019 low 10782 till the closing on 01 Oct
2019. I took this recent chart so that readers can check and back test
themselves. On this chart:</p>



<p>All the thin Red Lines are 23%
retracement of last wave (c).</p>



<p>All the thick Red Lines are
38% retracement of last wave (c) [breakeven Point).</p>



<p>All the Blue Dotted Line are
minimum Targets after break of 38% retracement.</p>



<p>But before going further, let us explained what the word “retracement” is and what do we mean by 23%-38% retracement.</p>



<p><strong>Retracement:</strong> Retracement is referred as a percentage of
reversal of a particular wave. The 23%-38% retracement of wave (c) means
23%-38% reversal of wave (c).</p>



<p>Example: Suppose wave (c) is
from 10837 to 11181, then wave (c) is of 344 points (11181-10837). 23%-38% of
344 points is approx 82-132 points. We need to subtract these 82-132 points
from the end of wave (c) then levels falls at 11099-11049. This 11099-11049 is
23%-38% retracement of wave (c) in this case. </p>



<p>Now let us explain same conditions and calculations on this Nifty hourly chart 1. We marked 23%-38% retracements with red lines but we didn’t write the values for the sake of clarity. Values are explained in explanation below. It might be difficult for you to understand the charts by just looking at it, but don’t be confused and read chart step by step with us as we explained below.</p>



<p><strong>Look carefully at chart and try to identify the bounce from
10782-11181:- </strong></p>



<p>You can see that this bounce
from 10782-11181 is 3 waves move which we marked as (a), (b) and (c) in brown
letters. Wave (a) started from 10782 whereas wave (c) started from 10837 and
ended at 11181. Wave (c) is from 10837-11181.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave
(c) [from 10837-11181] is placed at 11099-11049. Please look carefully at
decline after 11181 and observe that 38% retracement 11049 (thick Red Line) is
broken and then Nifty bounced back to enter in 11049-11099 range (38%-23%) and
then declined back twice by 100-140 points from 11049-11099 range. It again
entered third time in 11049-11099 range, registered high 11146 and then
declined back to achieved minimum downside target 10837 [Start of wave (c)].</p>



<p><strong>Now look carefully at decline from 11181-10637: –</strong></p>



<p>You can see that decline from
11181-10637 is 3 wave move which I marked as wave (a), (b) and (c) in Red
letters. Wave (c) is from 11145-10637.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave
(c) [from 11145-10637] is placed at 10756-10831. Please look carefully at
bounce after 10637 and observe that 38% retracement 10831 (thick Red Line) is
broken and then Nifty declined back to enter in 10831-10756 range (38%-23%),
registered low 10757 and then bounced back to almost achieved minimum upside
target 11145 [Start of wave (c)]. Nifty bounced till 11141.</p>



<p><strong>Now look carefully at bounce from 10637-11141: –</strong></p>



<p>You can see that bounce from
10637-11141 is 3 wave move which I marked as wave (a), (b) and (c) in Blue
letters. Wave (c) is from 10757-11141.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave
(c) [from 10757-11141] is placed at 11050-10994. Please look carefully at
decline after 11141 and observe that 38% retracement 10994 (thick Red Line) is
broken and then Nifty bounced back to enter in 10994-11050 range (38%-23%),
registered high 11042 and then declined back to achieved minimum downside
target 10757 [Start of wave (c)]. Nifty declined till 10746.</p>



<p><strong>Now look carefully at decline from 11141-10746: –</strong></p>



<p>You can see that decline from
11141-10746 is 3 wave move which I marked as wave (a), (b) and (c) in Blue
letters. Wave (c) is from 11042-10746.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave
(c) [from 11042-10746] is placed at 10815-10859. Please look carefully at
bounce after 10746 and observe that 38% retracement 10859 (thick Red Line) is
broken and then Nifty declined back to enter in 10859-10815 range (38%-23%),
registered low 10816 and then bounced back to achieved minimum upside target
11042 [Start of wave (c)]. Nifty bounced till 11084.</p>



<p><strong>Now look carefully at bounce from 10746-11084: –</strong></p>



<p>You can see that bounce from
10746-11084 is 3 wave move which I marked as wave (a), (b) and (c) in Blue
letters. Wave (c) is from 10816-11084.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave
(c) [from 10816-11084] is placed at 11020-10981. Please look carefully at
decline after 11084 and observe that 38% retracement 10981 (thick Red Line) is
broken and then Nifty bounced back to enter in 10981-11020 range (38%-23%),
registered high 11016 and then declined back to achieved minimum downside
target 10816 [Start of wave (c)]. Nifty declined till 10670.</p>



<p><strong>Now, move to bit bigger pattern and have a careful look at decline
from 11141-10637:-</strong></p>



<p>This decline from 11141-10637
looks like a 3 waves move with wave (A) completed from 11141-10746, wave (B)
completed from 10746-11084 and wave (C) completed from 11084-10637, we marked
it in brown colour.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave
(C) is placed at 10767-10828. 38% retracement 11828 was broken and minimum
upside target 11084 (start of wave C) was achieved but Nifty didn’t enter in
10828-10767 range (38%-23% retracement) before bouncing towards targets this
time.</p>



<p><strong>Now, move to further bigger pattern and have a careful look at
overall bounce from 10637-11694:-</strong></p>



<p>This bounce from 10637-11694
looks like a 3 waves move with wave (A or 1) completed from 10637-11141, wave
(B or 2) completed from 11141-10670 and wave (C or 3) completed from
10670-11694, we marked it in Red letters.</p>



<p>23%-38% retracement of wave (C
or 3) is placed at 10452-11302. 38% retracement 11302 is broken on 01 Oct 2019.
So according to “Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% retracement breakout strategy”
11302-11452 is immediate resistance and 10670 is minimum downside target. Now,
it is your work to see how Nifty reacted on 03 and 04 Oct or how it is going to
react in coming days or if it will achieve target 10670 or not. </p>



<p>Please observe the calculations
on charts carefully and see that in all the 3 waves (abc) move, trend changed
after break of 38% retracement of wave (c), 38%-23% retracement changed from
Support to Resistance or Resistance to Support every time, Nifty entered in
38%-23% retracement and reverse back till start of wave (c). </p>



<p>There is only one case when
Nifty breached 23% mark after break of 38% (first case), otherwise Nifty didn’t
even breach 23% mark in other cases. 38%-23% acted as most effective
Support/resistance most of the time.</p>



<p>The proof and importance of
38% retracement breakout is there on this hourly chart. It didn’t happen just
once or twice but repeated several time on same chart within 1 and half month.
It happened about 6-7 times in 45 days on hourly chart but if you see on 5
minutes chart then this pattern repeats on daily basis.</p>



<p><strong>Let us go deeper and show more examples within the same move on separate
chart:</strong></p>



<p>Look carefully at decline from
11181-10637 on above hourly chart. I am zooming out the chart and showing same
move on separate hourly chart below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="./SWEEGLU ELLIOTT WAVES 38% RETRACEMENT BREAKOUT TRADING STRATEGY _ Sweeglu Elliott Wave_files/AC-Hourly...png" alt="" class="wp-image-4064" width="474" height="467" srcset="http://sweeglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AC-Hourly...png 566w, http://sweeglu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AC-Hourly..-300x296.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"><figcaption>Nifty Hourly Chart 2</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is again hourly time bar chart of Nifty covering decline from 11181-10637. I zoomed in this move separately to show that same pattern is repeated on this chart 3-4 times within this move. </p>



<p>Look carefully at (abc)
decline from 11181-10906 with wave (c) from 11121, then look carefully at (abc)
bounce from 10906-11077 with wave (c) from 10936-11077, then look carefully at
(abc) bounce from 10906-11145 with wave (c) from 10924-11145. </p>



<p>Read the chart step by step same
as I explained earlier and check yourself how Nifty reacted after break of 38%
retracement of wave (c).</p>



<p>We are writing this Article on 06 Oct 2019, so let us show you the example of very last session which happened this Friday on 04 Oct 2019.</p>



<p>The trade suggestion was sent to Live Update Subscribers on 04 Oct 2019 by WhatsApp Broadcast:</p>

<p>You can read the wording of
trade suggestion in the WhatsApp screenshot above. The reason and calculations
for this trade suggestion is explained on next chart:</p>

<p>This is 5 minutes time bar chart of Nifty covering Intraday move of 04 Oct 2019. Now read this chart carefully and read on wording of trade suggestions carefully. Match the trade suggestion with chart and observe yourself how Nifty reacted.</p>



<p>We are suggesting readers to
calculate and observe the reaction themselves because readers will get
practical experience by doing it.</p>



<p>Also observe the bounce from
11263-11330 on this 5 minutes chart and observe the same pattern within this
move. Nifty gave 02 low risk trading opportunities based on 38% retracement
strategies in a single day. You may find more than twice such type of pattern
in the same move if you see it on 1 minute chart. </p>



<p>This strategy is explained on
Nifty Charts, but if you invest some time and observe yourself then same
pattern forms on Bank Nifty, Stocks, Currencies and Commodities too. This
article will turn into a book if I explained more. </p>



<h2><strong>Key Points of 38% Retracement Strategy of Sweeglu Elliott Waves: –</strong></h2>



<ol><li>Whenever
there is a 3 waves move, 23%-38% retracement of 3<sup>rd</sup> wave is most
effective support/resistance and 38% retracement is most effective trend
reversal point. No other analysis gives such effective trend reversal point.</li></ol>



<ul><li>23%-38%
retracement of 3<sup>rd</sup> wave becomes most effective resistance/support
(resistance becomes support and support becomes resistance) after break of 38%
retracement and price mostly reverse till the start point of 3<sup>rd</sup>
wave.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Price
rarely reverse back beyond 23% mark after successful break of 38% retracement.
It makes 38%-23% as most effective and low risks entry levels for trade.</li></ul>



<ul><li>We
can still earn good profit even if we are wrong at counting waves. If you have
knowledge of Elliott Wave Theory then you will see that overall Elliott Wave
Counts and Patterns are wrong on hourly chart in some cases but this strategy
is still giving profit. That is the reason I declared it most profitable and
accurate trading strategy because profit can be earned even if are wrong at
identifying the whole pattern.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Planning Low Risk Trades based on Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% Retracement
Breakout Strategy:</strong></h2>



<p>The best Low Risk High
rewarding trading strategy is to wait for successful break of 38% retracement
of 3<sup>rd</sup> wave and then wait to buy/sell in 38%-23% range with stoploss
some points beyond 23% mark for minimum target of start point of 3<sup>rd</sup>
wave. </p>



<p>Or wise traders can make their own trading strategy according to their Capital Limit, Risk Tolerance and Trading style. We might not be good at making trade plans but we gave you a precious diamond from our treasure of experience, you can make even better trade plans than us. We gave you an idea for your research, it is up to you how deep you can go.</p>

<h2><strong>Accuracy of Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% Retracement Breakout Strategy:</strong></h2>



<p>We never focus or care about
accuracy because accuracy is not practically applicable on analysis methods.
Even we encourage our clients/students to ignore the word “Accuracy”. Accuracy
is just a marketing word promoted by Stock Market advisor to lure clients,
otherwise it doesn’t have any significance. Wise traders talks about Risk
Reward, they never care about accuracy.</p>



<p>This trading strategy gives
minimum risk reward of 1:2 and traders can be in profit even if 30%-40% of the
trades go right. This is how we answer if you ask about accuracy. </p>



<p>Otherwise, we are not giving
you trading recommendations but we gave you our Skills and Experience. You can
observe and calculate the accuracy yourself.</p>



<h2><strong>Who can use Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% Retracement Breakout Strategy?</strong></h2>



<p>This trading strategy is back
tested for years and works in any market conditions, it works more efficiently
when the overall pattern is complex and when world is struggling to identify
market moves accurately. But those who knows the rules of Sweeglu Elliott Waves
can only use this strategy perfectly because you can’t mark any move as 3 waves
or (a), (b), (c).&nbsp; There are definite
rules and calculations to mark a move as (abc) and this strategy works perfect
only when you are able to identify a 3 waves (abc) move perfectly. Otherwise
any one can use it because you can still identify a (abc) move casually some
times even if you donlt know the rules but those who know the rules or (abc)
wave can use it most effectively.</p>



<p>For Sweeglu Elliott Waves Book
Subscribers and Students, there is nothigh new in this Sweeglu Elliott Waves
38% retracement breakout trading strategy. It is the same which I had explained
in chapters “Importance of 38% retracement” and “Alternate Wave Counts”. And I
am showing the same things in every of my analysis report. If you read the book
carefully and observe my daily analysis reports then you will find that we are
doing the same thing every next day. This 38% retracement breakout trading
strategy is just the further extension of the chapter “Importance of 38%
retracement” with recent practical examples.</p>



<p>This Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38%
retracement breakout trading strategy is not all about Elliott Wave Theory.
This is just a precious diamond from the treasure of our years of research and
experience. Otherwise it is not even 10% or Elliott Wave Theory. </p>



<p>There are other many other
trading strategies based on 3-3-5 Flat Corrections, Irregular Correction,
Triple Zigzag Correction, extended wave 5, Leading Diagonal etc. All these
trading strategies are even more effective for different type of trades in
different type of conditions. Some strategies can identify sharp moves suitable
for buying options and some are most effective to identify point to point
reversal. </p>



<h2><strong>The Real Life Practical Application of Elliott Wave Theory in
Trading:</strong></h2>



<p>We “Sweeglu Elliott Waves”
never care about what is written in books and what is written in theory.
Anything which work for us is our rule and our focus is always on practical
Application of Elliott Wave Theory. Our rules of Elliott Wave Theory may be
different because we eliminated which doesn’t work practically and refined
which worked best for us. The aim of any analysis method is to identify low
risk profitable trades from this market, having theoretically knowledge and
making guesses doesn’t work for traders.</p>



<p>We always practiced and taught
Practical Application of Elliott Wave Theory and we are doing the same since
years. This Sweeglu Elliott Waves 38% retracement breakout trading strategy is
one of the masterpieces of our Practical Application of Elliott Wave Theory
which we are sharing free to everyone.</p>



<h2><strong>Where can you learn Practical Application of Elliott Wave Theory?</strong></h2>



<p>We assume everyone here is
intelligent enough to take decision where or how they can learn. We can just
give our advice and suggestions. There are many institutions and trainers who
just have bookish/theoretical knowledge but are not able to apply it
practically. Please refer trainer’s work and see how he/she is applying Elliott
Wave Theory on real time charts and how they are planning trades based on their
analysis. Just plotting the waves on charts doesn’t work, trainer must be able
to plan Low Risk trades with exact entry levels, stoploss and targets based on
the analysis.</p>

Trend decider - Sport | Futures – 5 min | 15 min | 1 hr | 1 Day: 

Do NOT go below 3 min for Entry, Re-Entry, TL BO, SL, use 1 min only to draw TL 

TL to be connecting using swings only, use Lux-Algo Trendline swing with lookback 3  

Reversal on Strong Bullish or Bearish day (RSI >55 and <45 in both 1 hr. & 15 min) only below conditions are satisfied both in Spot and Option chart  

5 min | 15 min – Trend line BO candle close is must 

Previous swing is too steep, then ignore TL, candle close above / below previous swing high / low  

Double Top (DT) | Double Bottom(DT) - RSI divergence is must in both 5 min | 15 min 

Trend Side  

TL break in 3 min | 5 min in Option is sufficient  

High Probability - Combine DB/DT with Trend...In downtrend try DT | In uptrend try DB 

Trend Side – DB / DT – just 5 min divergence is sufficient  

Re-Entry – Option Buy (after Trend side confirmation): 

3 min | 5 min – Bullish engulf (when no swing is there) - break above previous candle high candle (on aggressive move) close confirmation is always the best , not recommended in sideways market  

3 min | 5 min - Bullish Trend line break out (Once two swing is formed for TL) – candle close confirmation - connecting lower top swing highs   

Option - Initial stoploss & Partial booking targets (50%)  

Initial SL - Entry Breakout (BO) candle low | Previous candle of Entry BO candle low 

Initial Targets - 5 min Option chart – Book 50% at Initial Target say 50EMA, VWAP(Century), VWAP 200 EMA using Limit Order, reversal trade initial target 50 EMA, if above 50 EMA then target 200 EMA 

Remaining position keep trailing stoploss or entry price (not to get into loss)  

Option – Trailing stoploss (50%)  for ultimate Targets 

On non-aggressive move 5 min | 3 min chart - Swing lows  

On Aggressive Wave C move -  Previous 5 min | 3 min - Solid Candle low / Red Candle low followed by Green Candles / Red candle close below 5 EMA in 5 min | 3 min 

Keep Trailing Stoploss if you are not able to view the market (may be meeting or sleeping)  

Option - Ultimate Targets: 

15 min Option chart - Ultimate Target - Trend line | Resistance Zone, also keep watch for Wave C 

Spot | Future - Trend Line & Swing - Resistance & Support in 15 min | 1 hour chart  

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

15 min - Watch out for Head & Shoulder pattern – Break out  

Need to watch out for RS zone and TL in both Spot and Futures  

OR Trade  - 5 min | 10 min | 15 min - Trend Line break in GIFT Nifty, better avoid first 5 min ~ 10 min to avoid violent moves, since GIFT Nifty have continues chart than Nifty  

Option OI Chart should support the move for further and immediate move – when prices moves up, Calls unwind and Puts add, vise-versa. If not there, then it will find Resistance or Support 

TL BO will fail if  

No divergence in 15 mins TF of SPOT 

If price is not bouncing from support 

On Expiry day OI works very well as cheap contract create huge build up, so always try in the money contracts even on expiry 

Risky to trade long & shot when 15 min sport RSI > 80 & <20  

Resistance & Support Zone  

15 min & 1 Hr - Draw rectangle covering many swings and congestion zones  

Trend line (TL) - Draw line touching as much as possible swing Closing price, wick High & Lows (its ok if few places cut candles)  

Trend line which previous provided support do act as resistance after they broke esp on pull back. This is effective when other RS zone also exist there  

Previous Day High & Low  

CPR – Central Pivotal Range, Virgin CPR 

 

Double Top & Double Bottom  

Against the Trend Reversal Double Bottom - Regular  Bullish Divergence - Price making either Equal Low or making lower low, But RSI making Higher Low 

Trend Based Double Bottom - Opposite Divergence - Price making either Equal Low or higher low But RSI making Lower Low  


  

Entry – Option Buy chart - Aligned to Sport | Futures - Trend deciders: 

3 min | 5 min - Bullish Trend line break, Candle close above TL is must,  provided 50 EMA > 200 EMA 

15 min & 5 min – Bullish RSI divergence (even if price is below 50 EMA) + Bullish engulf candle close above previous red candle | Hammer  

Sideways in the last 1 hour of Previous day and the next day if TL BO happens then enter 

Option price between 120 to 200+ (not beyond 250) give good move 

  

 

Initial Option Buy - Stoploss & Targets 

Hold the remaining 50% with Trailing SL Order, if position closed then use Re-Entry methods  

  

 

 

NO Trade - Consolidation day - Spot price oscillate within: 

30 min Open Range, if not broken (candle close) before 11 am this could be consolidation day  

Previous Day Range 

Flat 5min 20 EMA 

Risk Management: 

Do NOT lose more than 2% of your capital per day, 0.5% of capital risk per Trade 

Target 2% profit with risk is 1% 

Option buying 10% of Capital 

Do NOT trade first 15 min of open due to unpredictable violent moves as well as last 15 min due to limited movement  

Stop trading (Freeze Trading A/C) for the rest of the day if 2 stoploss are hit, example each stoploss value Rs.3000, then max loss Rs.6000 for the day 

Limit the number of trades – 3 max  

Do not lose more than 30% of the profit or more than 50% of profit if profit value is low  

Index Option trading – only Intraday   

if we don't do partial booking, we would be in panic mode always.. 

Partial book and moving SL rest of the position to buy price will ensue we go negative and always close with min profit  

  

Option Selling - Option Chart: 

Bought 24700 CE and Sold 24900 CE - this is called Bull Call Spread.. 

5 mins TF - 50 EMA < 200 EMA (so Option trend is down) and Double Top around 50 EMA with Bearish Divergence - Target next swing low

My Worst Trade of 2023 - Option Buying  

 


Spot chart for directions 

Option chart for refined entry and for target levels 

NO TL BO in OPTIONS,  NO TRADE 

OI vs Premium chart to see what kind of movement could be expected 

Downtrend, when small gap-up happens, and when price takes support of that open candle low and then it could be possible small up move 

Counter trend beyond 5 min 200 EMA is not suggested unless reversal is confirmed in 15 min | 1 Hr    

Option buying behave Elliot ABC corrective patter with wave C being ferocious up move, as majority  impulse move is down side! 

After initial Target, prices will correct, Try to catch the third Wave C once price break corrective trend lines & always keep Trailing SL to catch full move  

TL / RS – breakout confirmation means 3 min | 5 min – candle close only not wicks  

Expiry day reversal – after 1 pm – see 15 min TF divergence, enter once 5 min Trend line Breakout  

Try 1 lot,  achieve 200 points profit  + 1 month has to pass – to confirm you can hold 200 points profit, then double the lot size, like this increase  

Safe Trading – not  more than 3 trades in a day and not averaging  

YES==>> Small Profit, Big Profit, Small Loss (Planned setups, Strict original SL level, Profit trailing, Target booking, Limiting the number of trades per day) 

NO==>> Big Loss (No risk management) 

NO==>> Bad Profit, Bad Loss (based on random entries) 

Spot chart is to decide which direction to trade and also to roughly find out when to trade, ultimate targets of overall move 

Option chart is for accurate entry and exit 

TL BO in either 4 hrs. (candle close confirmation) or Daily TF for buying options positionally 

Morning Star & Evening Star + Higher Low | Lower Top – indicate start of impulsive wave  

Back test any strategy with 50 ~ 100 examples  

VWAP Auto Anchor in Option Chart with Anchor Period as Century, this can be used as entry and target. Usually Option expiry at this point  

If Target is not clear, then go for option selling in the favorable direction instead of option buying  

Candle patter 


 

How to Draw Trend Line (TL) 

TL should always start from the top 

Connecting 1st 2 swing high is critical for the main trend 

and another TL can be drawn connecting further swing highs 

find a TL that has 3 touch points before the BO. (can view to lower TF like 1 min | 3 min)  

 

 

Notes – completed till 20 Oct 2025 from Muruganatham chats  

 

 

Daily Trade lesions: 

Failed to keep Trailing SL to reap full benefit  

Keep proper initial SL & trail SL either previous candle low or 5 EMA in 3 min | 5 min 

Bet downside when RSI is above 60 in both 15 min & 60 min  

Brought option without TL Break  

Partial booking is not done, close with buy price without any profit  

Do not rebuy near option resistance as well as Spot RS zone. Wait for clear breakout otherwise rebuy will hit stoploss in consolidation  

A breakout may hit stop loss, but if it breaks out again in the same direction then the move will be very strong. This is to weed out  weak hands. 

Better use 5 min close confirmation than 3 min  close confirmation, 3 min can be used to draw trend lines 

SL also 5 min solid candle low is good or Red low in case red-green-green, in case of 3 min swing low will be better. In case there is slow movement  

Don’t risk much against trend as well as when OI & change OI is not supporting

Entry:
* Spot | Future - Never trade against LTLB|HTHB - Both 15 min and 5|3 min should concur | wait for 5 min TL break + Candle close confirmation (candle wick fails)

* Option + Spot | Future - Double Bottom | Top entry at R/S zone + RSI/MACD divergence - reasonable Bounce | Solid candle close, Keep SL at swing low, once SL hit, but still at R/S zone then wait for 5 min candle close above/below recent Swing H/L or Wick H/L

Highest loss occurred on days - NO STOP LOSS, AVERAGING OUT without TECHNIC ANALYSIS - Eg. Assumed Morning Trend will continue after correction but it reverse completely by EOD - 19Nov24: 20K loss & 13Dec24: 25k loss. Remember after SL hit rebuy on Fav cond is best way to avoid loosing huge by continues holding
Crux:: Partial profit => profitable trader, Bull in 3 min > 1 min + 2% buffer 
Option 3 min Entry:: Bear to Bull - LTLB to HTHB >> BO TL conn. Swing LT & Cd. close above N-1 Swing LT 
Option Re-Entry Buy SL with 2% above::1) Bullish HTHB [HB not broken] in 1 & 3 min :: Rebuy if price Engulfs Solid red candle in 1 min 2) Bearish in 1 min [HB broken] & Bullish in 3 min :: Rebuy if HTHB [LT break] forms in 1 min 3) Bearish in 3 min :: ReBuy if HTHB forms in 3 min
Option price TSL:: Slow move 3 min #SM:: N-1 | N-2 Swing Low clear & deeper FA Agg. move #FAM 1 min:: solid cd. Low L:N-1 | M:N-2 | XL:30~60%. 
Option Book Profit :: 1) Initial part profit (25% ~ 50%):: at Res - 50 | 200 ema / VWAP | Pre Swing High | TL 2) Rest (50% ~ 75%):: move SL to min. Buy price < #SM < #FAM. Keep SL below 2% to avoid hunt 
Trend Direction Future 3 min (better if 15 min also concurs):: HTHB | LTLB #Sw, N-1 Sw must HT|HB / LT|LB, Consol.::if N-1 Sw neither | Price within 15 min |  Prev Day  range & VWAP SD1, wait for BO | #Rev only HB | LT 1x/2x clear & deeper swing H/L break & Cd. close | Immed Engulf close above H/L of Solid L cd.

Note:
Bull | Bear:: wrt Pre candle Highs | Lows | Best when both H/L confirm | #Sw Swing HB/LT as R/S only if it has HT/LB | Immed. Engulf, strength may cont. in Engulf side
Expiry trade:: Open Int, Max Pain, both side bet are all useless
Positional:: Overnight | No SL:: both side bet 75~60%(trend) vs 25~40% (counter trend), Intraday:: SL must, never against 3 min & 15 min - Dow theory

Trade if 1 min Spot NO touch 20 & 50 EMA, & Clear gap between 50 & 20 EMA
On Strong Trend Day, Don’t trade with higher qty on counter trend side, also watch out for OI, counter trend side will be option writing, option price may not appreciate in counter trend side, buy only clear candle close above 1x | 2x LT swing high in 5 min will confirm reversal in spot. 1x Swing break or 80% engulf may not work. Option price should close green above previous solid red candle high. 


At Open & Close - check Higher time frame 1 Hr, Day chart - Strong Trend, Consol., Pullback & Reversal (Strong Trend to continue after consol., faraway O.Nigh posistion can be JP)

Spot 5 min:
ORB + PreDayRB Spot Entry <10:00:: ORB 9:25 | 9:30 | 9:45, Check 10 min Spot ORB is Subseq. confirm by stronger 15min ORB & Pre-Day Range. #faster TL break 1 min

Range Breakout >5x 5 min cd. | Wait n Watch if Trend side prev Cd. >61% XL / L / 3x M - L / H breaks by Engulf by L / XL Cd. (1 | 2 Cd.) indicate reversal in 1 / 5 min, Trend side re-entry only retrace >61% XL | L | >3x M PB candles
Enter Option position only when Spot Price shows Bullish or Bearish wrt Pre candle Highs | Lows | Best when both H/L confirms in 5 min + should match HTHB | LTLB patter 5 min as well as in 1 min 
No Trade if Price does oscillate around 10/20 & Not clear HTHB | LTLB formation | with ORB | any Range 
 
Option 1|5 min:
Buy only when Bullish - Resistance Trend line break | HTHB | cross above prev red M | L solid cd. high | >80% engulf close green if prev XL red cd. 
Once moment started during pullback / consol. Rebuy only by keep Buy SL open for bullish BO above TL | Prev L | Solid Red cd. high for next move, esp. strong durinTrending move.
Stop-loss:: On Tending large move - Under solid bar 5 min | Swing low of 1 min | N-1 61~80% XL Cd. | N-1 L Cd. low | N-2 M Cd. low | N-1 / N-2 Swing low during Consol.( whichever is Deeper) | Support Trend line break. [No big SL we can always rebuy esp during Consol.]
Candle should close above prev candle high in 1 min to buy option

Notes:
ORB:: Spot Range BO is key than Option price pattern as Option price is volatile in Open
￼ORB:: Pre day 5min chat price pattern is no significance  
Strong Trending day reentry near 20 EMA 5 min chat Option / Spot 
On huge Gap, first half pullbacks are to best and cheap way to enter large trend for the day 
Consolidation / pull backs in the middle of the strong trending days are best to enter positional bet for jackpot  
Option prices raise very fast and fall fast too, prudent buy on breakout after Consol. and wait for next Consol. for re-entry after large move. It is very risky to buy after siginficant move as fall will be violent. Option prices riase base on crazy traders buy in and fizzle out soon
Consol. Day:: No Trade - Spot price oscillate  within 45 min OR / Previous day range, flat VWAP, 5min 20 EMA &  SD1, very low prob. of BO/Expiry BO. Try others
Expiry Day>2:00pm:: No Trade Confusion on selecting Put | Call, Scaled / Over trade, unreliable SL, Unreliable HTHB / LTLB pattern, But Both side bet @ 1:30pm at 1st or 2nd OTM can be tried.

N-1 61% XL Candle
N-1 L Candle low
N-2 M Candle low 
N-1 | N-2 Swing low during Consol.(whichever is Deeper / Large) 
Don’t keep SL under Shallow Swing Low with S Candles

#C Consol. Day:: No Trade - Spot price oscillate  within 45 min OR / Previous day range, flat VWAP, 5min 20 EMA &  SD1, very low prob. of BO/Expiry BO. Try others
Expiry Day>2:00pm:: Confusion on selecting Put | Call, Scaled / Over trade, unreliable SL, Unreliable HTHB / LTLB pattern, But Both side bet @ 1:30pm at 1st or 2nd OTM can be tried. 

Watch out both Put & call, N & N-1 contracts | Pull backs 38~61% are good Re-Entry | Market move independent of News, Global Market  | Do trade over priced options | Never Trade based on OI, R/S | Avg move::Nifty/Mid Cap - 0.5% | Bank/Fin Nifty - 1% | S.Trend Day / Expire closes usually at peak of Trend | On >2x / 3x Profit close min 30%~50% of position | One Exit Stragery for all types of Entry | Daily Overnight Bet [N-1/N-2 Expiry esp after Consol day] Entry::only after 3:00 | 70% on Trend side 21 EMA 1 hr & 30% on counter trend - if funds > 30% Acc Val



Exit SL / TSL - is not followed correctly 
Option 5 min price - pre Swing Low | Low of [below solid L cand N-1 | far away 1min SwLo] | 20 EMA | Consol. after Agg. Move:: 1 min - HTHB SwLo break. After SL hit wait for Entry cond.
Option Buyer:: Green candle close above pre M / L candle high | 61% for XL candle 
SL below L / 61% of XL can catch large move 
After 2:30pm Expiry bet 5%~10% of Acc without SL (Full loss) 
Stop loss below L / XL candle is suggested for positional and when larger move is expected. If position IS closed keep buy stop loss open to catch the expected move 
Use 1 min option chart to enter when LTLB / Swing highs / resistance Trend line breaks upside & exit when HTHB / swing lows / support tend lines breaks. In case of 5 min candle use previous candle H/L & Trend lines - L & XL candles. Do not use previous candle in 1 min which is not reliable 
Overnight position should be taken only after 3pm. But all other position is to follow intraday SL - TSL

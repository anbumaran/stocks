* Trade if 1 min Spot NO touch 20 & 50 EMA, & Clear gap between 50 & 20 EMA* On Strong Trend Day, Don’t trade with higher qty on counter trend side, also watch out for OI, counter trend side will be option writing, option price may not appreciate in counter trend side, buy only clear candle close above 1x | 2x LT swing high in 5 min will confirm reversal in spot. 1x Swing break or 80% engulf may not work. Option price should close green above previous solid red candle high. 
* At Open & Close - check Higher time frame 1 Hr, Day chart - Strong Trend, Consol., Pullback & Reversal (Strong Trend to continue after consol., faraway O.Nigh posistion can be JP)

Spot 5 min:
* ORB + PreDayRB Spot Entry <10:00:: ORB 9:25 | 9:30 | 9:45, Check 10 min Spot ORB is Subseq. confirm by stronger 15min ORB & Pre-Day Range. #faster TL break 1 min
* ORB Reversal >80% Retrace from BO point to Day H/L | >61% Retrace from Day H/L to Open H/L + Aligned to Larger TF Trend | VWAP SD1 | No Trade if 5 min Cd. Close above/ below pre Trend side Solid L | XL Cd. H/L
* Always check:: M.Enter if Spot Prices HTHB / LTLB | beyond 10 / 20 EMA (if HTHB / LTLB NA in S.Trend) + VWAP SD1 | S.Trend Reversal only on N-2 Swing break (if N-1 is not deep) |  #faster 2x HB / LT + Prices beyond >61% from N-1 Swing | Trend line break of multi Swing | Consol. Range Breakout >5x 5 min cd. | Wait n Watch if Trend side prev Cd. >61% XL / L / 3x M - L / H breaks by Engulf by L / XL Cd. (1 | 2 Cd.) indicate reversal in 1 / 5 min, Trend side re-entry only retrace >61% XL | L | >3x M PB candles
* Enter Option position only when Spot Price shows Bullish or Bearish wrt Pre candle Highs | Lows | Best when both H/L confirms in 5 min + should match HTHB | LTLB patter 5 min as well as in 1 min 
* No Trade if Price does oscillate around 10/20 & Not clear HTHB | LTLB formation | with ORB | any Range 
 
Option 1|5 min:
* Buy only when Bullish - Resistance Trend line break | HTHB | cross above prev red M | L solid cd. high | >80% engulf close green if prev XL red cd. 
* Once moment started during pullback / consol. Rebuy only by keep Buy SL open for bullish BO above TL | Prev L | Solid Red cd. high for next move, esp. strong durinTrending move.
* Stop-loss:: On Tending large move - Under solid bar 5 min | Swing low of 1 min | N-1 61~80% XL Cd. | N-1 L Cd. low | N-2 M Cd. low | N-1 / N-2 Swing low during Consol.( whichever is Deeper) | Support Trend line break. [No big SL we can always rebuy esp during Consol.]
* Candle should close above prev candle high in 1 min to buy option



Notes:
* ORB:: Spot Range BO is key than Option price pattern as Option price is volatile in Open
* ORB:: Pre day 5min chat price pattern is no significance  
* Strong Trending day reentry near 20 EMA 5 min chat Option / Spot 
* On huge Gap, first half pullbacks are to best and cheap way to enter large trend for the day 
* Consolidation / pull backs in the middle of the strong trending days are best to enter positional bet for jackpot  
* Option prices raise very fast and fall fast too, prudent buy on breakout after Consol. and wait for next Consol. for re-entry after large move. It is very risky to buy after siginficant move as fall will be violent. Option prices riase base on crazy traders buy in and fizzle out soon
* Consol. Day:: No Trade - Spot price oscillate  within 45 min OR / Previous day range, flat VWAP, 5min 20 EMA &  SD1, very low prob. of BO/Expiry BO. Try others
* Expiry Day>2:00pm:: No Trade Confusion on selecting Put | Call, Scaled / Over trade, unreliable SL, Unreliable HTHB / LTLB pattern, But Both side bet @ 1:30pm at 1st or 2nd OTM can be tried. 



Spot Trend Bullish | Bearish in 5 min Chart::
HTHB | LTLB | Break previous candle H/L

* Immediate pull back >61% show strength in same direction and stoploss hunts. If it is next candle it should engulf fully 
* Bullish Continue: a) Ordinary HTHB not break HB-2 down side b) Violent Large Swing retrace not > 50~61% + not form LTLB | if Complex PB | LTLB formed it should reverse break LT-1 up side and raise back >50~60% c) Correction Consolidation Ordinary LTLB break up side LT-1 | LT-2 (consider which ever is Large/Deep swing) 
* Bullish to Bearish: a) Break down side Support Trend line a) Ordinary HTHB break HB-1 | HB-2 down side b) Large Swing retrace >61% + Price immeditatly not raise >50~61% + form LTLB pattern and not break LT-1 upside

Buy Option with 1 min chart, Once Sport 5 min is Bullish or Bearish is confirmed:
* Trend Line break >10x Candle highs / Swing highs in case of ranged consolidaton
* Break up side LT-1 Pre Swing High (Lower Top)
* Break up side previous Candle High if size XL, L, M
* ReEntry till 60% corr. from far away HT+ > pre solid candle high
* ReTrace >60% from far away HB|HL, if LB|LL then >78% Immediate engulf

SL / Exit Option 1 min chart - Never close position without this:
* Option prices raise very fast and fall fast too, prudent buy breakout after conslidation and wait for next consolidation re-entry after large move. It is very risky to buy after siginficant move as fall will be violent. Option prices riase base on crazy traders buy in and 
* N-1 61% XL Candle
* N-1 L Candle low

* All Entry based on 5 min option chart pre candle cross (not applicable on multiple red candles) + also see 1 min option Swing High is crossed + 5 min Spot should match bull or bear / SL | Exit - 1 min chart. Don’t re buy on violent move in 1 min / only when price consolidate in 1 min chat 
* Trend may not always need to close peak, follow price pattern then assumptions 
* #S Exit [Sell SL order]::Option price -  HL/SwLo before HT,  Move SwLo after HT corr. move become bullish #B | Never close position without this >>  N-1  61% XL/ N-1 L Cd. low / N-2 M Cd. low / Deeper Swing low during tight Consol. don’t keep SL under Shallow SwLo with S Cd. in 5 min / 1 min |  > 10x cand, TL break | >61% for faraway SwLo | No Big SL, S.Trend use 5 min, 1 min if faraway | TSL 70% lock profit Book 50% position for Profit >40%, rest 50% SL @ min buy price, Open mostly looses money only short time it gains.

* After 1:30 pm on Expiry(better avoid)::Bet both side with total loss expectancy & TSL on large profit
* Avg Mov::Nifty/Mid:0.5% Bank/Fin Nifty 1%
* Entry #1 & Re-Entry #2 based on Spot 5 min candle close confirm. to avoid SL hunt by price spikes. Buy cheap on Pullback but not against HTHB LTLB | 20EMA 5min Trend lines are early indicator than swings

* ORB T::10 min @ 9:25 | Trend Trade:: After 11 am 20 EMA x 5min
* Diff index may move differently in a day
* Price HTHB LTLB is the KING… Relative price of Option and future premium movement are not reliable data 
* On a Strong Trending week, Expiry may be on Trend Side Max, PB are Re-Entries

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Expiry Trade::Max loss Day,  Avoid Over night position as Unfav Open loss induce Neg. mind set to Scaled & Over trade to cover Loss Over Trade  and Trade without Analysis.  Premium will Fall Fast during Open, Consolidation, Better Trade after 1:00pm with 50% SL and Max loss Limit. 
* Price movement before 2hrs before expiry is mystery. Beware of Reduced Premium induce Scaled Position, High leverage High loss & Overtrade too.

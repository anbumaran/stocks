If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Trend decider - Sport | Futures – 5 min | 15 min | 1 hr | 1 Day: 

15 min - Trend Line break  

15 min - Double Top (DT) | Double Bottom(DT) - RSI divergence is must, price can be equal 

High Probability - Combine DB/DT with Trend...In downtrend try DT | In uptrend try DB 

Reversal DB/DT must have Trend line BO + RSI not >60 & <40 in 1 Hr. & 15 min  

15 min - Watch out for Head & Shoulder pattern – Break out  

Need to watch out for RS zone and TL in both Spot and Futures  

OR Trade  - 5 min | 10 min | 15 min - Trend Line break in GIFT Nifty, better avoid first 5 min ~ 10 min to avoid violent moves, since GIFT Nifty have continues chart than Nifty  

If RSI is >60 | <40 in both 15 min & 1 hr chart then it is strong trending momentum  

Option OI Chart should support the move for further and immediate move – when prices moves up, Calls unwind and Puts add, vise-versa. If not there, then it will find Resistance or Support 

On Expiry day OI works very well as cheap contract create huge build up, so always try in the money contracts even on expiry 

Risky to trade long when 15 min sport RSI > 80 & <20, preferred range 60~80 & 40~20 

  

Resistance & Support Zone – 15 min & 1 Hr - Draw rectangle covering many swings and congestion zones  

Trend line (TL) - Draw line touching as much as possible swing Closing price, wick High & Lows (its ok if few places cut candles)  

 

Double Top & Double Bottom  

Against the Trend Reversal Double Bottom - Regular  Bullish Divergence - Price making either Equal Low or making lower low, But RSI making Higher Low 

Trend Based Double Bottom - Opposite Divergence - Price making either Equal Low or higher low But RSI making Lower Low  


  

Entry – Option Buy chart - Aligned to Sport | Futures - Trend deciders: 

3 min | 5 min - Bullish Trend line break, Candle close above TL is must,  provided 50 EMA > 200 EMA 

15 min & 5 min – Bullish RSI divergence (even if price is below 50 EMA) + Bullish engulf candle close above previous red candle | Hammer  

Option price between 120 to 200+ (not beyond 250) give good move 

  

Re-Entry – Option Buy: 

3 min | 5 min - Bullish engulf - break above previous candle high, candle close confirmation is always the best on aggressive move 

3 min | 5 min - Bullish Trend line break - connecting lower top swing highs   

 

Initial Option Buy - Stoploss & Targets 

Initial SL - Entry Breakout (BO) candle low | Previous candle of Entry BO candle low 

Initial Targets - 5 min Option chart – Book 50% at Initial Target say 50EMA, VWAP(Century), VWAP 200 EMA using Limit Order  

Hold the remaining 50% with Trailing SL Order, if position closed then use Re-Entry methods  

Option buying behave Elliot ABC corrective patter with wave C being ferocious up move, as majority  impulse move is down side! 

After initial Target, prices will correct, Try to catch the third Wave C once price break corrective trend lines & always keep Trailing SL to catch full move  

  

Trailing Stoploss - Option chart  

On non-aggressive move 5 min | 3 min chart - Swing lows  

On Aggressive Wave C move -  Previous 5 min | 3 min - Solid Candle low | Red Candle low followed by Green Candles  

Red candle close below 5 EMA in 5 min | 3 min 

 

Ultimate Option -Targets: 

15 min Option chart - Ultimate Target - Trend line | Resistance Zone, also keep watch for Wave C 

Spot | Future - Trend Line & Swing - Resistance & Support in 15 min | 1 hour chart  

 

  

NO Trade - Consolidation day - Spot price oscillate within: 

30 min Open Range, if not broken (candle close) before 11 am this could be consolidation day  

Previous Day Range 

Flat 5min 20 EMA 

  

Risk Management: 

Do NOT lose more than 2% of your capital per day, 0.5% of capital risk per Trade 

Target 2% profit with risk is 1% 

Option buying 10% of Capital 

Stop trading (Freeze Trading A/C) for the rest of the day if 2 stoploss are hit, example each stoploss value Rs.3000, then max loss Rs.6000 for the day 

Limit the number of trades – 3 max  

Do not lose more than 30% of the profit or more than 50% of profit if profit value is low  

Index Option trading – only Intraday   

if we don't do partial booking, we would be in panic mode always.. 

  

Option Selling - Option Chart: 

Bought 24700 CE and Sold 24900 CE - this is called Bull Call Spread.. 

5 mins TF - 50 EMA < 200 EMA (so Option trend is down) and Double Top around 50 EMA with Bearish Divergence - Target next swing low

7 tips for becoming a successful day trader - https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-becoming-a-successful-day-trader/answer/Shraddha-Nanchahil 

Spot chart for directions 

Option chart for refined entry and for target levels 

OI vs Premium chart to see what kind of movement could be expected 

Downtrend, when small gap-up happens, and when price takes support of that open candle low and then it could be possible small up move 

Counter trend beyond 5 min 200 EMA is not suggested unless reversal is confirmed in 15 min | 1 Hr    

Expiry day reversal – after 1 pm – see 15 min TF divergence, enter once 5 min Trend line Breakout  

Try 1 lot, see you can achieve 200 points profit  + 1 month has to pass – to confirm you can hold 200 points profit, then double the lot size, like this increase  

Safe Trading – not  more than 3 trades in a day and not averaging  

Candle patter 


 

How to Draw Trend Line (TL) 

TL should always start from the top 

Connecting 1st 2 swing high is critical for the main trend 

 and another TL can be drawn connecting further swing highs

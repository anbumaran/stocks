~-~-~Praise The LORD JESUS~-~-~  

If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.  

- James 1:5  

 

Entry Conditions:   

First 45 min ORB trade base on GIFT Nifty (continues chart than Nifty) Trend Line (TL) Break Out (BO) & Trailing Stoploss (TSL) close position once previous candle low or high is broken in Spot or Option - 3 min | 5 min, better avoid first 5 min ~ 10 min to avoid violent moves 

Consolidation in the last 1 hour of Previous day, Enter if TL BO in next day 

All entry must have non steep TL BO | Swing BO confirmation  

A clear TL connecting Swings in 3 | 5 min and non-steep <45 degree will give good move  

If multiple solid Red / Green candles and TL just connecting only Candle wicks | Candle Close (without swings) | Swings in 1 min | Steep TL >> this TL BO may not give good move or may even give false BO 

Do not enter if target is near | already achieved, unless clear BO 

Check both Spot and Future for Entry and Targets  

5 min TL & TL BO is more reliable than 3 min | 1 min  

 

Reversal Conditions – Sport & Option Chart: 

Sport – 5 min Candle Close Confirmation beyond 5 min N-2 | 15 min N-1 Swing Higher lower | Lower Top, Do NOT use TL BO as it is confusing and bound to fail  

15 min RSI divergence + Double Top | Bottom (not far away) near important RS Zone | TL + Swing BO (5 min N-2 | 15 min N-1) is already confirmed  

BO High | Low of Previous Day | Current Day | 15 min Open Candle  

If no 15 min TL | Swing available then 5 min Price aligned to 5 & 21 EMA 

 Swing based confirmation Best and proven method, this is identified after several failures and Double Bottom | Top is essential so expect pull back to initial price levels after initial Swing BO confirmation  

 

 Re-Entry Aggressive – Trailing SL | Swing Not broken:  

Aggressive Re-Enter using 1 min - horizontal Rectangular BO | Angular TL BO provided there is Support zone in 1 min, provided prices does not break Trailing SL like Solid candle low | retrace >50% of recent Swing low to Swing High and there is no multiple red candles, all other case use 3 min | 5 min TL BO 

Solid Green candle engulf above Solid Red candle in 3 | 5 min and there is no multiple Solid Red candles  

 

Re-Entry - TSL & Swing broken, but Direction not violated in 15 min 

No Swing available Previous candle low is broken, but No lower low | Consolidates in a range >> then Solid Green Engulf CCC above recent High | High above failed wick | Range of Candle Trend Line BO CCC 

No Swing available and Multiple Solid red candle closes lower and lower >> Enter once >61% retracement CCC from the low  

Two Swing available, but first one is too steep then don’t use TL | Only one Swing is available >> Enter once Price crosses & closes above recent Swing high with CCC in 3 min | 5 min (preferred)  

Two or more Swing available, No Swing is too steep (<50 degree) to each other, then draw TL using 5 min & 3 min Swings does not cut candle body with maximum touch point to swings and nearby candles - close and wicks >> Enter once Price crosses & closes above TL in 3 min candle close confirmation (CCC). It will be good have 3 swings (non is too steep) for better TL, Keep SL lowest of Lows of Entry Candle | N-1 Entry candle | Swing low | Below extended Trend line after BO 

High Probability - Combine DB/DT with Trend...In downtrend try DT | In uptrend try DB + Just 5 min divergence is sufficient, Double Bottom | Top, there should be strong TL | RS Zone | near and above 15 min 50 / 200 EMA not in between | not too away | not BO >> Enter once TL is BO as said above 

Note: Initial RS | TL BO candle close can be used as stoploss point for re-entry  

Entry  on clear TL by connection swings will give good move than TL connection wicks or not clear swings 

 

Option - Initial stoploss & Partial booking targets (50%)  

Initial SL - Entry Breakout (BO) candle low | Previous candle of Entry BO candle low 

Initial Targets - 5 min Option chart – Book 50% at Initial Target say 50EMA, VWAP(Century), VWAP 200 EMA using Limit Order, reversal trade initial target 50 EMA, if above 50 EMA then target 200 EMA 

Remaining position keep trailing stoploss or entry price (not to get into loss)  

Option – Trailing stoploss (50%)  for ultimate Targets 

On non-aggressive move 5 min | 3 min chart - Swing lows  

On Aggressive Wave C move -  Previous 5 min | 3 min - Solid Candle low, do not keep SL below Red Candle low unless it is swing low /  Red candle close below 5 EMA in 5 min | 3 min 

Keep Trailing Stoploss if you are not able to view the market (may be meeting or sleeping)  

Watch 1 min for green solid candle, 1 or 2 red small candle accepted, otherwise close it if it is near resistance, never close position in the strong momentum.  

Option - Ultimate Targets: 

15 min Option chart - Ultimate Target - Trend line | Resistance Zone, also keep watch for Wave C 

It will be fake BO if it  directly BO RS zone | TL  without price pull back.  

A genuine BO will Pull back at RS | TL zone and cross & close above RS | TL zone 

Spot | Future - Trend Line & Swing - Resistance & Support in 15 min | 1 hour chart  

 

Resistance & Support Zone  

15 min & 1 Hr - Draw rectangle covering many swings and congestion zones  

Trend line (TL) - Draw line touching as much as possible swing Closing price, wick High & Lows (its ok if few places cut candles)  

Trend line which previous provided support do act as resistance after they broke esp on pull back. This is effective when other RS zone also exist there  

Previous Day High & Low  

CPR – Central Pivotal Range, Virgin CPR 

RS zone - swings, gaps, consolidation zones  

 

Correction: 

Simplex Pullback  

Complex Pullback  

5 Wave Pullback – Ending diagonals 

Beyond that Ranged Consolidation    

 

NO Trade - Consolidation day - Spot price oscillate within: 

30 min Open Range, if not broken (candle close) before 11 am this could be consolidation day  

Previous Day Range 

Flat 5min 20 EMA 

 

Risk Management: 

Do NOT lose more than 2% of your capital per day, 0.5% of capital risk per Trade 

Target 2% profit with risk is 1% 

Option buying 10% of Capital 

Do NOT trade first 15 min of open due to unpredictable violent moves as well as last 15 min due to limited movement  

Stop trading (Freeze Trading A/C) for the rest of the day if 2 stoploss are hit, example each stoploss value Rs.3000, then max loss Rs.6000 for the day 

Limit the number of trades – 3 max  

Do not lose more than 30% of the profit or more than 50% of profit if profit value is low  

Index Option trading – only Intraday   

if we don't do partial booking, we would be in panic mode always.. 

Partial book and moving SL rest of the position to buy price will ensue we go negative and always close with min profit  

 

Option - Open Interest:   

Option OI Chart should support the move for further and immediate move – when prices moves up, Calls unwind and Puts add, vise-versa. If not there, then it will find Resistance or Support 

On Expiry day OI works very well as cheap contract create huge build up, so always try in the money contracts even on expiry 

Do not trade last 45 ~ 30 min of expiry  

 

Option Selling - Option Chart: 

Bought 24700 CE and Sold 24900 CE - this is called Bull Call Spread.. 

5 mins TF - 50 EMA < 200 EMA (so Option trend is down) and Double Top around 50 EMA with Bearish Divergence - Target next swing low

My Worst Trade of 2023 - Option Buying  

 


Spot chart for directions 

Option chart for refined entry and for target levels 

NO TL BO in OPTIONS,  NO TRADE 

OI vs Premium chart to see what kind of movement could be expected 

Downtrend, when small gap-up happens, and when price takes support of that open candle low and then it could be possible small up move 

3 min | 5 min - Bullish Trend line break, Candle close above TL is must,  provided 50 EMA > 200 EMA 

15 min & 5 min – Bullish RSI divergence (even if price is below 50 EMA) + Bullish engulf candle close above previous red candle | Hammer  

Option price between 120 to 200+ (not beyond 250) give good move 

Counter trend beyond 5 min 200 EMA is not suggested unless reversal is confirmed in 15 min | 1 Hr    

Option buying behave Elliot ABC corrective patter with wave C being ferocious up move, as majority  impulse move is down side! 

After initial Target, prices will correct, Try to catch the third Wave C once price break corrective trend lines & always keep Trailing SL to catch full move  

TL / RS – breakout confirmation means 3 min | 5 min – candle close only not wicks  

Expiry day reversal – after 1 pm – see 15 min TF divergence, enter once 5 min Trend line Breakout  

Try 1 lot,  achieve 200 points profit  + 1 month has to pass – to confirm you can hold 200 points profit, then double the lot size, like this increase  

Safe Trading – not  more than 3 trades in a day and not averaging  

YES==>> Small Profit, Big Profit, Small Loss (Planned setups, Strict original SL level, Profit trailing, Target booking, Limiting the number of trades per day) 

NO==>> Big Loss (No risk management) 

NO==>> Bad Profit, Bad Loss (based on random entries) 

Spot chart is to decide which direction to trade and also to roughly find out when to trade, ultimate targets of overall move 

Option chart is for accurate entry and exit 

TL BO in either 4 hrs. (candle close confirmation) or Daily TF for buying options positionally 

Morning Star & Evening Star + Higher Low | Lower Top – indicate start of impulsive wave  

Back test any strategy with 50 ~ 100 examples  

VWAP Auto Anchor in Option Chart with Anchor Period as Century, this can be used as entry and target. Usually Option expiry at this point  

If Target is not clear, then go for option selling in the favorable direction instead of option buying  

Double Top & Double Bottom  

Against the Trend Reversal Double Bottom - Regular  Bullish Divergence - Price making either Equal Low or making lower low, But RSI making Higher Low 

Trend Based Double Bottom - Opposite Divergence - Price making either Equal Low or higher low But RSI making Lower Low

How to Draw Trend Line (TL) 

TL should always start from the top 

Trend line should not cut body, try to fit trend as many swings as possible 

find a TL that has 3 touch points before the BO. (can view to lower TF like 1 min | 3 min)  

 

 

Notes – completed till 20 Oct 2025 from Muruganatham chats  

 

Core Values: 

Sport – 3 min | 5 min | 15 min, every entry check Spot for Bullish or Bearish, first 45 min TL BO entry w.r.t GIFT nifty ( & Exit Previous Candle break, After that HTHB, LTLB, TL BO  

Buy option only when 1) price is above 21 ema 2) TL BO 3) Double Bottom with divergence  

Re-Entry Option + Sport concur: 1) Super Agg. (Solid Cd low not broken) - pre. candle high break 2)  Candle close above Failed BO wick / swing 3) Trend line BO CCM 4) Clear candle close above range of candles > 5. [never buy as it is cheap, SL will hit] 

 

 

Daily Trade lesions: 

Failed to keep Trailing SL to reap full benefit  

Keep proper initial SL & trail SL either previous candle low or 5 EMA in 3 min | 5 min 

Bet downside when RSI is above 60 in both 15 min & 60 min  

Brought option without TL Break  

Partial booking is not done, close with buy price without any profit  

Do not rebuy near option resistance as well as Spot RS zone. Wait for clear breakout otherwise rebuy will hit stoploss in consolidation  

A breakout may hit stop loss, but if it breaks out again in the same direction then the move will be very strong. This is to weed out  weak hands. 

Better use 5 min close confirmation than 3 min  close confirmation, 3 min can be used to draw trend lines 

SL also 5 min solid candle low is good or Red low in case red-green-green, in case of 3 min swing low will be better. In case there is slow movement  

Don’t risk much against trend as well as when OI & change OI is not supporting  

Always trade for break out, do not buy as it is cheap and keep SL it will bound to fail  

 

TB Deleted: 

Aggressive - but Solid candle low | TSL broken | Swing low not broken | Higher Top Higher Bottom >>>  

If Swings available in 1 min chart, then Draw TL connecting Swings, enter when TL BO in 3 min CCC.  

If too Steep to draw TL | No swings available in 1 min >> Enter when Solid Green Engulf CCC in 3 min above solid red candle high | failed wick High  

BO above range of candle > 5 & CCC in 3 min  

Spot direction not violated -  if two Swing high available >>> Trend line BO + CCC is must, SL below entry | entry N-1 candle low | Best swing low if it is near  

Sport direction not violated, Swing broken, If no visible swing to draw trend-line | XL size candle >>>  re-enter when price retrace more than 50~60% in trend side + CCC 

Super Aggressive continues solid candle only, reversal >60% CCC wrt previous Swing | 3x 5 min candle engulf CCC (15 min) - which ever is faster  

Do NOT re-enter near resistance / support zone, unless a clear 5 min | 15 min CCC in Spot above / below RS zone / TL line 

After 2 continues Stop-loss, stop trading check for range bound trading in spot  

Do NOT go below 3 min for Entry, if market is slow moving use 5 min  

Draw TL Conn. Swing only – TL BO, (Check Swing  using - LuxAlgo Lookback '3') 

Swing BO Lower Top | Higher Bottom on the left, 5 continues candle BO candle close can be equal to TL BO,  3 x 5 min (=15 min) Solid candle engulf can be reversal if other factors support it like Resistance | Support | Trend line + Double Top | Bottom provided above Sport 15 min TF direction is not violated  

 

Reversal Conditions – Sport & Option Chart: 

Never try for reversal if RSI in 15 min | 1 hr. >60 and <40, Always trend for Trend Side entry instead of counter trend  

Double Top | Bottom near important Resistance Support (RS) Zone / Trend Line (TL), these should be nearby not far away  

Trend Line should be below <45 degree, steep TL indicate either very strong trend | Too steep Swings  

Bull to Bear: - There should be 3 Swing highs and 2 Swing lows to draw support TL 1) if  last Swing high is Lower High enter immediately once TL BO, 2) if wait for retracement to extended Trend line resistance if last swing high is higher high  

Price should be beyond 50 EMA w.r.t direction in 5 min 

Spot & Option – Reversal Raconsidered only if all the condition satisfy – 15 min Swing BO CCC | beyond 50% retracement in 15 min if Swing is too large & 5 min CCC + 5 min TL BO CCC  +  1x or 2x Swing BO in 5 min CCC + 15 min RSI Divergence with DT | DB + Strong RS | TL Zone + Price not near Swing High | Low for double Top | Bottom + RSI in 15 min | 1 hr. not > 60 | < 40 

Note >> Lower Top | Higher Bottom, Swing before new High | Low, not corrective Swing & Do not Consider 1 min | 3 min Swing for reversal 

Entry only when Option price is above 21 EMA in 3 min | 5 min, use 5 min if there is strong down trend. 

To get clarity on swing use  'LuxAlgo Trend – with Swing deduction lookback – 3 setting'
